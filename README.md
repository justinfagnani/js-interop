Dart JavaScript Interop - A New Hope
====================================

This package makes JavaScript interop easier and more powerful, allowing
developers to dfine Dart interfaces for JavaScript libraries, and to export
Dart libraries to JavaScript.

Status
------

This is an entirely new codebase from version 0.2.x and works in a completely
different manner. When released, it will replace 0.2.x entirely.

This package is not production-ready. It's published to allow developers to
try it out and submit feedback before it's finalized.
